    We need to supply our new factory with various 4 resources from 4 stations.
    For simplicity we name them as 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th resource (we leave it for your imagination).
    For this we need to calculate four routes from supply stations to the factory.
    But trucks will deliver supplies without stops and we can not build several layers roads.
    So routes should not intersected.
</p>

<p>
    You are given a rectangular map divided by square cells.
    The map is represented as a sequence of strings, where:<br>
    - "." is a clear cell;<br>
    - "X" is an obstacle (forest, lake, etc);<br>
    - "1", "2", "3" or "4" are supply stations;<br>
    - "F" is a factory.
</p>
<p>
    You should calculated four non intersected routes from each supply station to the factory.
    Each route is started in a station and should be ended in the factory.
    A route can be passed only by clear cells and should be in the map (trucks can not leave the map).
    Trucks can move in four directions:<br>
    - "N" north (up);<br>
    - "S" south (down);<br>
    - "E" east (right);<br>
    - "W" west (left);<br>
    A route will be represented as a string with these letters.
    The result should be as a sequence (list or tuple) of four routes from 1st to 4th.
